# Lab 3 - **Introduction to C  Programming**

## Install a C compiler on your machine

To run c programs on your machine, you will need to install a C compiler. If you are using your Linux system you created in the last labs, then you had already installed the Clang C complier.

You can perform this lab on any operating system. For Windows, you can install MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) and for macOS you can go with Clang

You can use these tutorials to install the C compiler:

1. Windows - [https://www.scaler.com/topics/c/c-compiler-for-windows/](https://www.scaler.com/topics/c/c-compiler-for-windows/)
2. macOS - [https://www.scaler.com/topics/c/install-c-in-mac/](https://www.scaler.com/topics/c/install-c-in-mac/)

You will also need a code editor. I would suggest Visual Studio Code but you can use anything you’re comfortable with.

## Lab Material

Refer to the presentation in the github repo.

## Programming examples

You can go through the code examples and try implementing your own functions.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

//Function example 1
/*The function has two arguments both integers. The return type is also an integer. 
The function requires a value and it's power and returns the result of value ^ power*/
int get_power_result(int value, int power){
  int result=1;

  for(int x1 = 0; x1 < power; x1++){
    result *= value;
  }
  
  return result;
}

//Function example 2
/*The implementation of the function is written at the after and otuside 
the main function. This is another way to declare your functions*/
int get_factorial(int value);
float get_division(int i5, int i6);

/*A.K.A. constant!*/
